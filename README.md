# Machine Learning Tests

This directory is mainly used for machine learning experiments and algorithm testing on different test data.


## Deployment

The easiest way for Deployment that I found was using PyCharm and Conda environment. If you are not sure if you have conda or not just run the command below in a terminal.

```bash
  conda
```
If conda is available, just create a new instance and download necessary libraries. Caution they might change from folder to folder, considering that you might need a different version of tensorflow.
